# Sample project made with Serverless framework

This is a WIP project made as showcase of some of the techniques I use in BE development

- Using mongo with mongoose

- Using typescript

- Unit tests with jest

- Integration test with jest

- Deploying in AWS using serverless framework

- Organizing the code separating libraries from business code

##### Upcoming work:

- Implement an Express server
- Implement a version using mysql
- Implement endpoints using Redis (have to figure out a good use case)
- Implement a graphql api using appsync
